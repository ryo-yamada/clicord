## Note
I'll be rewriting clicord because the code I wrote months ago is unreadable now... this repo will not be receiving anymore updates.
clicord itself on this repo is still usable, it's just annoying for me to update now so use it if you want to.

# clicord
A CLI (command-line-interface) client that allows you to communicate with people on Discord through a console.

## USE GUIDE

- Open a console and cd into the extracted folder
- Type `python main.py` in the console (You need to download Python at python.org to do this!)
- Follow the instructions

## UPDATELOGS
### v1.1
- Added account manager (now you have multiple account support!)
### v1.0
- First version

## PLANNED ROADMAP
